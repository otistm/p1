# Knowledge Base Changelog

Relay log — what changed in `docs/`, so the team stays in sync. Newest at top.

- **2026-06-30 (fix: live standings track the karts)** — "Board shows karts in different
  places than the track / doesn't update as they pass." Data-driven, not a guess: built
  `tools/diag/standings.ts` to compare the engine's `prog` ordering against the actual
  projected position over 60 seeds/round — the old dead-reckoned `cp` (accumulated movement,
  blind to collision shoves & wall slides) drifted ~85 m and disagreed with the track ~96 %
  of ticks (player mis-placed up to ~60 %). Fix: `racer.ts` now re-projects actual `(x,z)`
  onto the centerline each fixed step and accumulates a seam-corrected, lap-aware delta
  (`prog = lap*length + raw`), the standard racing-game measure (s&box/Unreal/Godot). After:
  ~11 % of ticks / ~1 % player, residual = ≤1-tick latency below the HUD poll. Regression
  test added (`engine.test.ts`); HUD poll 15→30 Hz. `sim-physics.md` gained a "Race progress
  + live standings" section; ADR recorded.
- **2026-06-30 (fix: leaderboard readability)** — The "race placement looks wrong" report was
  a naming collision, not a ranking bug: async ghosts are the player's past builds and shared
  the player's name, so the board showed multiple identical "Comet" rows. Fix: ghosts get a
  ` (ghost N)` suffix (`packages/game/src/snapshots.ts`) and the HUD/results mark the player
  as `name (you)` in cyan (`RaceHud.tsx`, `ResultsScreen.tsx`). Added a `logic.test.ts` case
  asserting unique entrant names with ghosts present. ADR recorded.
- **2026-06-30 (feature: conditional racing cards)** — Cards can now carry deterministic
  **triggered effects** evaluated in-sim against spatial/positional context. New
  `@grid/sim/effects.ts` (kinds, `EffectContext`, spatial `ZONE`s, pure `evaluateEffects`
  → modifier bag); `racer.ts`/`engine.ts` apply the bag (speed/steer/lateral line/collision)
  with a per-racer seeded effect RNG and per-sub-step ranking; `CardSchema` gained
  `effect`/`trigger`/`effectText`/`archetype`; 7 Phase-1 cards authored (+6 inert Phase-2
  scaffolds); effects attached to player/ghosts/rivals (`effectsFromCardIds`), `BuildSnapshot`
  gained `cardIds`, `SAVE_VERSION` 1→2 + migration; draft UI renders Trigger→Effect. Docs:
  new `cards-proximity-conditional.md` (design + TD review), updated `sim-physics.md`
  ("Card effects + spatial zones"), `economy-cards.md`, `content-schema.md`; ADR added.
  Tests: `effects.test.ts` (14) + determinism/absent-effects cases in `engine.test.ts`; the
  season harness gained an effects on/off balance pass (net-neutral win%, +overtakes).
- **2026-06-30 (balance finding: season difficulty curve)** — New experience harness
  `tools/diag/season.ts` ran ~2,250 races (player vs scaled rival field across the 3 cups).
  Findings: (1) the AI field is fun — ~0.3–0.5s winning margins, photo finishes in ~24–41% of
  races, ~18 overtakes each; (2) parts alone never compete — a starter build (OVR 193) finishes
  **last in 100%** of parts-only races; tuning parts only narrows the gap, never the place;
  (3) training + cards is the real lever — a developed player climbs 193→241→290→351 OVR and
  wins 70% of Rookie Cups; (4) **the season outruns one playthrough** — developed win% collapses
  70%→6%→0% as rivalScale ramps (×1→×1.28→×1.6), so the championship reads as multi-season meta
  progression. Vortex (all-rounder) still over-wins, matching the prior balance note. Summary
  canvas: `canvases/race-experience.canvas.tsx`.
- **2026-06-30 (sim fix: player won races they didn't)** — Race results/leaderboard showed the
  player winning when they were actually behind. Root cause: `finishTime` was the fixed step's
  end time, so all karts crossing the line within the same 1/60 s tick recorded an *identical*
  finish time, and `rank()`'s tie-break fell through to the racers' array order — the player is
  always entrant index 0, so they won every photo finish. Fix: record a sub-step crossing time
  (`ctx.time - (overshoot/alongThisStep)*dt`) so finishers are ordered by when they truly crossed,
  and tie-break equal times by `prog`. Deterministic + frame-batching invariant (engine always
  sub-steps `FIXED_DT`). Added a regression test (identical-kart packs across seeds: order must
  follow time-then-progress, never index). See `sim-physics.md` → "Finish ordering".
- **2026-06-30 (render fix: wheels spun backward)** — Kart wheels rolled the wrong way in
  both the showroom and races. Wheel geometry rolls about local +x, and with the nose at -z a
  *positive* x-roll drives the tops backward (+z). Both render sites used positive spin
  (`ShowroomKart` `+= dt*0.4`, `RaceField` `s.rotation.x = spin` from the sim's
  forward-growing `wheelSpin`). Fix: negate the applied x-roll at both sites (sim semantics
  unchanged — `wheelSpin` still tracks forward distance).
- **2026-06-30 (UX redesign: garage build screen)** — Replaced the garage's stacked parts-list
  + stat-card panel with a "blueprint" over the live showroom kart: per-slot callouts pinned
  around the kart with SVG leader lines pointing at the actual part, each opening an in-place
  popover of owned options with signed stat-delta chips (downsides in red) so every trade-off
  reads at a glance. `ShowroomKart` now takes `angle`/`radius`/`height` and holds a fixed 3/4
  view when `orbit=false`; `App` passes `orbit=false` + closer framing in the `garage` phase so
  the leader-line anchors (a single tunable `LAYOUT` table of viewport-% targets) stay pinned.
  Verified in-browser end-to-end (open/equip/stat-update). See `DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-30.
- **2026-06-29 (render fix: karts jump f/b — ROOT CAUSE)** — The real cause of the "karts
  jump forward/back" report: the ~15 Hz HUD state shared a React context with the engine, so
  every HUD tick re-rendered the 3D `RaceField`, whose parent passed a fresh `visualsById`
  object literal → `useMemo` **rebuilt all kart meshes 15x/sec**, and new groups render at the
  origin for a frame before `useFrame` repositions them = jumping. Fix: split `useRaceHud()`
  from `useRaceSession()` and memoize `visualsById`. The offline `jitter.ts` harness showed
  the sim/interpolation were already smooth — the bug was React, not the math. See
  `rendering-budget.md` → "Gotcha: React re-renders rebuilding 3D objects".
- **2026-06-29 (render fix: kart vibration)** — "Karts vibrate as they go by." First proved
  the motion is smooth with a new deterministic harness (`tools/diag/jitter.ts`): zero
  high-frequency wobble in interpolated kart/camera across 60/144/165 Hz with frame jitter.
  Root cause was **intra-model z-fighting** — kart parts (side pods, engine cover, air-box)
  shared exact face planes with the body and flickered with view angle. Fix: parts now
  interpenetrate a few cm (no coplanar faces). Also tightened the shadow-camera frustum
  (±98u→±66u) so kart shadows stop swimming. See `rendering-budget.md` → "Gotcha: kart
  'vibration'…". (Headless Chromium throttles rAF, so Playwright pacing numbers are moot.)
- **2026-06-29 (render fix: curb shimmer)** — Thin red/white curbs sparkled in the distance
  (geometric aliasing of sub-pixel solid-color boxes; MSAA can't fix it). Replaced the
  instanced curb boxes with one mipmapped + anisotropic striped-texture ribbon per side
  (seamless arc-length UVs); mipmapping averages the stripes to smooth grey far away, and
  draw calls drop to 2. Also made `TrackWorld` dispose `material.map`. See
  `rendering-budget.md` → "Gotcha: shimmer on thin high-contrast patterns".
- **2026-06-29 (render fix: track-edge z-fighting)** — Track edges shimmered as the camera
  moved (depth-buffer fighting, not motion). Causes: tight `near` plane (0.6/420 ≈ 700:1) +
  road sitting 0.02 above the big ground plane, plus the start line level with the curb
  tops. Fix: camera `near` 0.6→1.5, complementary `polygonOffset` on road (toward camera)
  and ground (away), and raised the start line to y=0.2. See `rendering-budget.md` →
  "Gotcha: z-fighting at the track edges".
- **2026-06-29 (render fix: race vibration)** — Karts/screen/environment vibrated during
  races. Root cause: `RaceField` read raw fixed-step sim transforms without interpolation,
  so on >60 Hz displays the 60 Hz accumulator stuttered and the chase camera amplified it
  scene-wide. Fix: added `Racer.prev*` snapshots + `RaceEngine.alpha`, and the renderer now
  interpolates all transforms and follows the interpolated player with frame-rate-independent
  camera smoothing. Determinism unaffected (prev fields are render-only). See
  `rendering-budget.md` → "Gotcha: always interpolate fixed-step state".
- **2026-06-29 (Phase 5 ship)** — Slice is polished and gated. Added `@grid/audio`
  (synth engine note + SFX wired to the race), reduced-motion support (showroom orbit +
  CSS), a Playwright e2e smoke that boots the real WebGL build through the full loop with
  zero page errors, vendor chunk-splitting, and an `e2e` CI job. All gates green:
  typecheck, 21 unit tests, lint (0 warnings), build, e2e.
- **2026-06-29 (balance pass)** — Rebalanced `derive()` to de-weight Wit (Phase 5). New
  2000-race spread: Vortex 60.1 / Atlas 20.7 / Blitz 14.6 / Oracle 4.3 / Crusher 0.3.
  Wit no longer dominates cornering (Power now leads `latGrip`). Known follow-up: the
  all-rounder (Vortex) still over-wins and pure-Power (Crusher) under-performs; tune in a
  future pass. Note this only affects AI rival flavor — players build their own karts.

- **2026-06-29 (impl)** — Phases 1-3 landed. `@grid/sim` (deterministic engine, 8 tests),
  `@grid/content` (parts/cards/cosmetics + Zod, loadout math, 8 tests), `@grid/game`
  (economy/draft/season/snapshots + Zustand store, 5 tests), `@grid/render` (R3F canvas,
  modular kart, instanced track/scenery). Layered stat model implemented exactly as
  documented: parts (baseline 30 + deltas) -> training deltas -> card mods -> clamp.
  Async opponents assembled via `assembleRaceConfig` (player + recent ghost builds +
  scaled archetypes), fully reproducible from a seed.

- **2026-06-29 (balance finding)** — First headless balance run (`npm run balance`, 2000
  races): Vortex 58.9% / Oracle 26.8% / Atlas 11.6% / Blitz 2.8% / Crusher 0.0%. Takeaway:
  **Wit is over-weighted** in `derive()` (it feeds accel, latGrip, yawGrip, drainEff, and
  judge), and pure-Power builds with low Wit are non-viable. Action: rebalance the `derive`
  coefficients in the Phase 5 tuning pass (target: every archetype 10-30% win share). The
  sim is unchanged for now to keep the build stable.
- **2026-06-29** — Seeded the knowledge base: `umamusume-loop`, `kart-anatomy`,
  `sim-physics`, `multiplayer-async`, `rendering-budget`, `economy-cards`,
  `content-schema`. Authored project rules (knowledge-base, determinism, perf-budget,
  coding-standards). Recorded six founding ADRs.
